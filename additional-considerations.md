I think some additional features we could add are an ignore list for certain devices and a way to test if a device allows connections. It might also be useful to display which devices can actually connect.

Regarding working with native bridge code for BLE or device-specific development, I'd first consider the CLI configuration. There's a more managed portion of the CLI and cloud, and then there's a more manual part that decouples some features between them.

For device-specific code, I'd write it on the respective platforms. I'd use Android Studio with Kotlin - I could use Java, but I don't see a reason to. For iOS development, I'd be working in Xcode.

I can foresee some potential challenges. For example, if we're sending over-the-air updates to a Bluetooth device, we might need to chunk the information. This process could differ between platforms and might not be straightforward in React. I'd need to investigate that further.

Other device-related issues would need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis between iPhone and Android. There's likely more to explore, especially when it comes to complex BLE operations that React Native might not handle easily.
